# === WORKING WITH EXAMPLE ===

x = 10 - 4 * 2  # Multiplication has higher precedence than subtraction
print(x)  # 2 

# Parentheses () has higher precedence
y = (10 - 4) * 2
print(y) # 12


# Precedence of or & and
meal = "vegetable"

money = 0

if meal == "vegetable" or meal == "sandwich" and money >= 2:
    print("Lunch being delivered")
else:
    print("Can't deliver lunch")

'''
This programms run if blocl even when the money is 0. 
It does not give the desired output since the precedence of and is higher than or
'''   


# We can get the desired output by using the ()
meal = "Fruit"
money = 0

if (meal == "Fruit" or meal == "Pizza") and money >= 2:
  print("Lunch being delivered !")
else:
  print("Can't deliver lunch")
